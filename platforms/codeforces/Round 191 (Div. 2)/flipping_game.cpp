// A much more efficient implementation using greedy algorithm
/* 
The approach works because it greedily selects the subarray that maximizes the score (number of 1s) after performing the flip operation.
By iteratively updating the maxScore based on the current element's contribution to the score,
the algorithm identifies the optimal subarray to flip in order to maximize the number of 1s.
